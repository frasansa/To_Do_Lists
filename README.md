# To_Do_Lists

In this repository I am putting, at least, one task a day (of working days). In addition, This repo has three main purposes:

1) To help to adquire the habit of pull and push between my personal laptop and the office computer.

2) To practice my english writing.

3) And last but not least, to sort out my workflow.
